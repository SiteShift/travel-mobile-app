### MVP Checklist

- **Scope**: Only the items requested below. Keep implementation minimal and focused for MVP.

### Open Book Animation & Create Book Page
- [ ] Front cover opens into a full-screen white page (no paper texture)
  - Front page flips open, then a slow zoom until the white page fills the screen
  - Remove the horizontal lines that currently serve as a paper texture
- [ ] Add a date picker so the user can input the date of their trip on this page

### Trip Creation Celebration & Routing
- [ ] After creating a trip (in the book animation flow), show a celebration / dopamine-hit moment
- [ ] Immediately navigate to the View Trip page for the new trip (do not return to the home page)

### View Trip Page Polish
- [ ] Remove the question mark icon from the top-left
- [ ] Prevent seeing the page layered behind when scrolling to the bottom and holding/swiping up
- [ ] “Add Memory” button styling changes
  - [ ] Use a grey, dotted outline
  - [ ] In Grid view, make the button full width and align its left/right spacing to match the image gallery columns
- [ ] “Add Memory” flow
  - [ ] Tapping “Add Memory” should open the photo gallery immediately (no take/choose/cancel prompt)

### Leveling Popup Simplification
- [ ] When the Level 1 Adventurer button (top-right) is tapped, keep the popup but make it very basic
